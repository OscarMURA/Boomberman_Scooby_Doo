// The code snippet is defining an enumeration called `AudioType`. An enumeration is a special type in
// Java that represents a fixed set of constants. In this case, the `AudioType` enumeration has two
// constants: `MUSIC` and `EFFECTS`. These constants can be used to represent different types of audio,
// such as music or sound effects.
